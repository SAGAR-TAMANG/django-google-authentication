## USER AUTHENTICATION USING GOOGLE'S OFFICIAL ACCOUNT IN DJANGO WEB APP

The following code that can be seen in this project basically encapsulates the usage of google's official login portal in the web app of django.

During the process of the writing of the code, I followed through this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6PP0vEOMc "YouTube Video Tutorial"), and also partially followed through [this article online](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/django-google-oauth/).
